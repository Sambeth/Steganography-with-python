# Steganography with Python

Hiding an image within another image

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
You can install anaconda from anaconda.org.

clone this repo and enter folder

run jupyter notebook
```


### What is Steganography about?

 MEANING AND HISTORY
 
 THE ART OF HIDING A MESSAGE WITHIN ANOTHER MESSAGE

 Histories of Herodotus, when Demeratus sent a secret message past guards by removing the wax from the tablet, writing on the tablet itself, and covering the tablet with wax again to disguise the message.


### What is an image(digital image)?

 AN IMAGE IS A COLLECTION OF PIXELS.
 A PIXEL IS THE SMALLEST PART OF A DIGITAL IMAGE

 A PIXEL IS TO A DIGITAL IMAGE WHAT AN ATOM IS TO AN ELEMENT OR WHAT A CELL IS TO THE BODYâ€¦..right?


### PIXEL PROPERTIES

* FIXED POSITION

* COLOR - WHICH IS MADE UP OF A MIXTURE OF THREE COLOR CHANNELS (RGB)


### RED, GREEN, BLUE

![RGB(255, 255, 0)][pixelbits]

![alt_text][rgbpixels]


### 8-BIT BINARY DIGIT CALCULATION

![Each color channel 8 bit binary digit][signit]
